Coding is like writing an essay. It cannot stop. If you stop , it mean that you dont have any idea or you got stuck. 

In order to master the code, one need to practice and remember the syntax for smooth writing the code. It better when you focus to only 1 thing for mastering it.

You can do all of the things but still you cannot be faster than specific to only 1 things. The logic is the same but the problem is the syntax and understanding the flow what happen next ,now .
